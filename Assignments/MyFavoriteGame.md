### 1. Who, What, When, and Where?

My favorite game of all time is, after reasonable consideration, *Elden Ring*. In case you're unfamiliar with the title, *Elden Ring* is an open-world action RPG developed by Japanese video game studio [FromSoftware](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/), released on February 25, 2022.

### 2. Why?

*Elden Ring* is, at this point in its history, almost indisputably one of the finest games of its generation. Game reviewers and casual consumers alike unsurprisingly received it with virtually universal acclaim, and it's quite obvious as to why. The in-game world is immense, the worldbuilding lives up to the reputation of its author (the author being, of course, George R.R. Martin of *Game of Thrones* fame), and its gameplay mechanics stand as nothing but an improvement upon the long-appreciated standards set by FromSoftware's earlier work. I was personally enticed, in my playthrough, by the incredible diversity in viable playstyles. With changes both minute and extreme in character stats, weapons, armor, special items, and summons, one problem can be approached in wholly dissimilar ways to equal success. To me, that's a hallmark of careful, skillful game design and it truly never lost its effect on me (despite the fact that I was a pure Strength/Ultragreatsword player for almost 75% of my run).

### 3. Regarding Past Titles

A good deal of the anticipation for *Elden Ring* during the pre-release period was derived from FromSoftware's notoriety as an RPG powerhouse. You're likely familiar with their past work: [*Demon's Souls*](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/demons-souls/), the [*Dark Souls*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls) franchise, [*Bloodborne*](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne/), [*Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*](https://www.sekirothegame.com/), the [*Armored Core*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/armored-core/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon) franchise, and much more. Interestingly, in researching the technical background of *Elden Ring*, I learned that it does not run on an industry-standard engine, but rather an updated version of an unnamed engine created by FromSoftware in the development of [*Dark Souls II*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls-ii). This same engine was used for the previously-mentioned *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice* as well as for [*Dark Souls III*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls-iii).
