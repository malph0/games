In this repository, I will be giving a bit of information on my favorite video game (you'll find out which it is elsewhere). To aid in your understanding of its importance to me and the world of video games, I'll lay out its context in gaming history, details regarding the software behind its performance, and some connections it may have to other titles you may or may not have heard of. 

I hope you appreciate the new knowledge.
